# Unit8 project

# Welcome to unit8  landing page project 👋

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
    npm i
    npm run dev
```


You can run this for lint validation

```bash
    npm run lint
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
